# add-engine-variant — Engine Enum Extension Gate

## When to invoke

This skill is the gate for any work that would add a variant to an existing engine enum. Run it BEFORE:

- Proposing an engine extension in a plan or task description
- Drafting an engine PR that adds a variant
- Approving an audit verdict of "engine extension required"
- Wiring a converter arm to a not-yet-existing variant

If you find yourself about to type `pub enum Foo { ... NewVariant ... }` in `crates/engine/src/`, pause and run this skill.

## The three filter stages — all must pass

### Stage 1: Existence verification (5-grep protocol)

The variant might already exist under a different engine-native name. The mtgish AST and the engine vocabulary are not 1:1; the engine often has the concept under a different name.

> The canonical engine surface is `data/engine-inventory.json` (gitignored). Run `cargo engine-inventory` to (re)generate it locally before grepping for existing variants.

Run **all five searches** before considering extension:

```bash
# 1. Direct name search
rg -n "<concept_keyword>" crates/engine/src/types/

# 2. Inverse concept (engine often expresses "not X" as "X { negated: bool }" or "X { negated: true }")
rg -n "<inverse_concept>" crates/engine/src/types/

# 3. Inversion-parameter variants
rg -n "negated: bool|invert|polar" crates/engine/src/types/ability.rs

# 4. Native parser reverse dictionary — how does oracle_nom express this concept?
rg -n "<concept_keyword>|<engine_concept>" crates/engine/src/parser/oracle_*.rs

# 5. Synthesis layer
rg -n "<concept_keyword>" crates/engine/src/database/synthesis.rs
```

**Stage 1 verdicts:**

- **EXISTS_SAME_NAME**: variant exists. Stop. Wire to it.
- **EXISTS_DIFFERENT_NAME**: concept exists under engine-native name (e.g., mtgish `CreateTriggerUntil` ↔ engine `Effect::CreateDelayedTrigger`). Stop. Map mtgish AST to the existing slot.
- **EXISTS_AS_PARAMETER**: concept exists as a parameter value of a more general variant (e.g., "untapped" exists as `Tap { negated: true }`). Stop. Use the parameter form.
- **DOES_NOT_EXIST**: proceed to Stage 2.

If the audit you're acting on said "extension required" and Stage 1 returns EXISTS_*, the audit is wrong. Cite the file:line of the existing slot and refuse the extension.

### Stage 2: Parameterization filter

If the slot truly doesn't exist, the next question is: *should it exist as a sibling, or should the parent enum be parameterized so the new concept becomes a parameter value of an existing variant?*

For each candidate enum, look for the **sibling-cluster smell**:

- Three or more variants that share a name root (`X` / `OpponentX` / `TargetX` / `AllX`)
- Three or more variants that differ only in a context label (`UnlessControlsCountMatching` / `UnlessControlsMatching` / `UnlessControlsOtherLeq` — the axes are scope and comparator)
- Three or more variants that differ only in a comparator/aggregator/scope dimension
- Three or more variants where the structural differences could be expressed as a `(op, scope, target)` tuple

If you find one, **the proposed variant is almost certainly a parameterization gap, not a missing sibling.** Compare:

| Smell | Refactor target |
|---|---|
| `LifeTotal` / `OpponentLifeTotal` / `TargetLifeTotal` (+ proposed `LifeTotalAggregate`) | `LifeTotal { player: PlayerScope }` where `PlayerScope` is `Controller \| Target \| Opponent { aggregate } \| AllPlayers { aggregate }` |
| `HandSize` / `OpponentHandSize` (+ proposed `TargetHandSize`) | `HandSize { player: PlayerScope }` |
| `UnlessControlsCountMatching` / `UnlessControlsMatching` / `UnlessControlsOtherLeq` | `UnlessQuantity { comparator: Comparator, filter: TargetFilter, count: QuantityExpr }` |
| `WhenLeavesPlay` / `WhenLeavesPlayFiltered` / `WhenDies` / `WhenDiesOrExiled` | `WhenZoneChange { destination: ZoneFilter, source_filter: TargetFilter }` |

**Stage 2 verdicts:**

- **REFACTOR_FIRST**: sibling-cluster smell detected. Open a parameterization-refactor round (Round Π-N) that consolidates the existing siblings AND absorbs the new concept as a parameter value. Do NOT add the proposed variant. The strict-failure tag is the right place to leave the gap visible while the refactor is pending.
- **EXTEND_OK**: no sibling-cluster smell — the proposed variant is genuinely orthogonal to existing variants. Proceed to Stage 3.

The compounding-cost rule: one new sibling has near-zero cost; ten siblings make the eventual refactor multi-week as call sites multiply across parser, converter, resolver, and tests.

### Stage 3: Categorical-boundary check

If you've decided extension is appropriate (either as a new variant or as a parameter on an existing one), the proposed parameterization axis MUST lie within a single CR rule section.

Cross-section unification belongs at:

- `TargetFilter` (already enumerates any subject type — players, creatures, planeswalkers, battles, etc.)
- The effect handler (where rules unify behavior — `Effect::DealDamage` per CR 120 handles all damage subjects uniformly)

NOT at:

- `QuantityRef` / `FilterProp` / `ReplacementCondition` / similar leaf-reference layers

**Examples of category errors to refuse:**

- `Life { target: {Self, Opponent, Creature}, type: {Total, Remaining} }` — conflates CR 119 (player life) with CR 120 (damage marked) and CR 209 (toughness). Three rule sections, three different runtime resolvers. Refuse.
- `ZoneCount { subject: {Player, Creature, Spell}, zone: ZoneRef }` — subjects belong to different scopes (game-wide for Player, battlefield for Creature, stack for Spell). The unification belongs at `TargetFilter`, not here. Refuse.

**Stage 3 verdicts:**

- **WITHIN_SECTION**: parameterization axis is within a single CR rule section. Extension is approved. Proceed to implementation.
- **CROSSES_SECTIONS**: refuse the parameterization. Push the unification to `TargetFilter` or the effect handler. Re-design.

## After all three stages pass

If you've made it through all three stages with EXTEND_OK / WITHIN_SECTION verdicts:

1. **Verify CR annotation via grep.** Every new variant carries a CR number, and every CR number is verified by grepping `docs/MagicCompRules.txt` BEFORE the annotation is committed. The 701.x and 702.x ranges are arbitrary sequential assignments and are especially prone to hallucination — do not trust memory.

2. **Update all exhaustive `match` statements.** Use `cargo check -p engine` to find them. NO wildcard fallback arms to silence the compiler — those mask future variant additions.

3. **Classify the variant in the fail-closed ability-scan walker.** If the enum is traversed by `crates/engine/src/game/ability_scan.rs` (the C0 classifier: `Effect`, `QuantityRef`, `QuantityExpr`, `TargetFilter`, `TriggerCondition`, `StaticCondition`, `ReplacementCondition`, `AbilityCondition`, `Duration`, `PlayerFilter`, `ObjectScope`, `ControllerRef`, and their sub-enums), a NEW *variant* fails to compile there (exhaustive, no `_` fallback) — add an explicit per-axis classification arm. A NEW *field on an EXISTING variant* is only caught if that variant's arm destructures without `..`: NONE arms and projected-resource (axis-3) arms already do (compiler-enforced), but CONSERVATIVE arms keep `..`. So if you add a read-bearing field to a variant the walker classifies as CONSERVATIVE, promote its arm to an explicit destructure and classify the field on every axis. The growing-cascade detector's soundness rests on axis 3, so a silently-dropped projected-resource read is a false combo-win.

   The same discipline applies to the walker's **resolution-time choice classifier** (`effect_resolution_choice_freedom` / `ability_resolution_choice_freedom` in `crates/engine/src/game/ability_scan.rs`, consumed by `analysis::resource::loop_states_cover_modulo_growth` item 6): a NEW `Effect` variant fails to compile there until classified. The default classification is `MayPrompt` (fail-closed — an unproven claim only costs a false-negative cover rejection). Classifying a variant as choice-free (`FreeUnlessLifeReplacements`, or any future `Free`-class verdict) is a SOUNDNESS claim — "resolving can never enter a non-priority `WaitingFor`, for ANY state" — and requires (a) a resolver trace cited in the arm's comment (file:line of the handler in `game/effects/` proving no `WaitingFor` raise on any path, including replacement-pipeline calls such as `replace_event`'s `NeedsChoice`), (b) destructuring the arm without `..` so a future field forces re-audit, and (c) updating the pinned guard test (`resolution_choice_verdicts_are_exactly_pinned`). A new field on a `MayPrompt`-classified variant needs no action (`{ .. }` arms are already fail-closed).

   The same discipline applies a THIRD time to the **read/write conflict profiler** (`crates/engine/src/game/ability_rw.rs` — `ability_rw_profile` / `trigger_condition_rw_profile`, consumed by `game::triggers` legacy-path ordering, CR 603.3b): a NEW variant on any traversed enum fails to compile there until classified (exhaustive, no `_` fallback), and a NEW read/write-bearing field on an existing variant is caught only where the arm destructures without `..` — precise arms bind ALL payload fields (the module's binding mandate), but maximal-conservative arms keep `{ .. }`. If you add a read- or write-bearing field to a variant the profiler classifies precisely, classify it in BOTH `ability_scan.rs` (per-axis) AND `ability_rw.rs` (kind+scope read/write profile). An elided read in the profiler is fail-OPEN for the same-event ordering gate (a missed conflict auto-orders an order-dependent group — CR 603.3b unsoundness), so this is a soundness obligation, not bookkeeping.

   The profiler classification is NOT just kind+scope: three **decision-bearing boolean axes** directly drive `profiles_conflict`'s same-event discriminators, and each must be considered for every new variant/field. (a) `reads_member_bound` — does the resolution consult per-source bound storage (`TrackedSet`/`ExiledBySource`/chosen-attribute/attachment carriers, CR 603.10a look-back)? A missed `true` auto-orders distinct sources reading their own piles (the #5072 R3 HIGH-1 failure mode — Mimic Vat class). (b) `reads_event_live` — does it read the triggering object's CURRENT state (`EventSource`/`EventTarget` scopes, CR 608.2h)? (c) `writes_event_object` — does it mutate the shared event object? (b)×(c) together form the same-event write-then-read feed (`reads_and_writes_event_object()`, gated on `event_object_present` — the #5072 R4 failure mode). Mis-setting any of these is a same-event under-prompt (rules-wrong) or an unclassified over-prompt (sweep RED).

   After classifying, **run the full-DB parity sweep** (`FORGE_TEST_FULL_DB=1 cargo test -p engine ordering_parity_sweep` — NOT in default CI, see #5073) and read the delta. The predicate-keyed conservative classes (`se_member_bound_class`, `se_event_object_class`) absorb new corpus members automatically — no allowlist edit for a conservative flip. But the genuine exact-sets (`SAME_EVENT_MEMBER_BOUND_GENUINE`, `SAME_EVENT_EVENT_OBJECT_GENUINE`) are completeness-asserted: if your new variant makes a card genuinely order-observable (order changes reachable outcome STATES, not merely choice points), the card must be ADDED to the const with per-card CR evidence — the assert failing is the system working, never suppress it with a floor bump.

4. **Document runtime status.** If the variant is type-only (no runtime handler yet), add `// RUNTIME: TODO — converter accepts this; engine handler is a no-op stub. CR <X>` on the variant doc-comment. Type-only stubs are acceptable; silent runtime stubs are not.

5. **Pair with converter arm in one commit.** Engine extensions ship with the converter arm that uses them, in a single coherent commit. Don't batch unrelated engine extensions.

6. **Concurrency contract.** Engine extensions ship in a separate PR before the converter PR depending on them, OR in one paired commit if the work is done by a single agent. No half-extensions.

7. **Serialized-surface audit.** Before implementation is complete, determine whether the enum appears in game state, `GameAction`, `WaitingFor`, card-data export, AI/community scenario fixtures, saved test fixtures, client adapter types, or any wire-visible protocol. If yes, add the required serde defaults, migration / compatibility path, regenerated fixture, or protocol version bump. Include a test or CI evidence that existing repo-owned serialized data still loads. If protocol-visible, bump the wire contract or prove no serialized shape changed.

## Anti-patterns this skill prevents

- "Audit said add variant X" → adding sibling without verification (the audit is wrong about a third of the time per session metrics)
- "Engine doesn't have it" → without grepping for engine-native names (CreateTriggerUntil mtgish ↔ CreateDelayedTrigger engine)
- "Just one more sibling" → ignoring the sibling-cluster smell and compounding parameterization debt
- "Unify under one type" → crossing CR rule sections and conflating runtime resolvers
- "Type-only stub returning a placeholder true/false" → masks runtime correctness; pair with real evaluation logic before shipping. The historical example: `ReplacementCondition::CastViaKicker` initially shipped with a `=> true` stub that silently over-applied to non-kicked spells. Resolved by adding `Option<KickerVariant>` to the variant and tracking `SpellContext.kickers_paid` at cast resolution — the runtime now actually evaluates the gate. Always verify the resolver does what the variant doc-comment claims.

## When refusing

If this skill returns REFUSE_WITH_REFACTOR or REFUSE_WITH_FILTER_LIFT, your output to the orchestrator should include:

1. The exact stage that failed (Stage 1: EXISTS_*, Stage 2: REFACTOR_FIRST, Stage 3: CROSSES_SECTIONS)
2. The evidence (file:line citations, grep output, sibling cluster identification)
3. The recommended alternative (the existing slot to use, the refactor round to open, or the layer where unification belongs)
4. The cards/coverage being deferred and the strict-fail tag to leave in place

Refusing is the correct outcome when any stage fails. Coverage waits, architecture wins.

## Inputs / outputs

**Invocation:** describe the proposed extension — the enum, the variant, the audit or task that proposed it, the cards it would unlock.

**Output:** one of:
- `APPROVED: <enum>::<variant> { <fields> }` with CR annotation, runtime-status doc-comment, and ready-to-implement signature
- `REFUSE_WITH_EXISTING_SLOT: use <engine_path>:<line>` with the wiring to use instead
- `REFUSE_WITH_REFACTOR: open Round Π-N consolidating <sibling_cluster>` with the proposed parameterized form
- `REFUSE_WITH_FILTER_LIFT: push to <TargetFilter | effect_handler>` with the cross-section unification target

The output is binding. If APPROVED, proceed. If any REFUSE_*, the extension does not ship until the refusal's recommended alternative is taken.
