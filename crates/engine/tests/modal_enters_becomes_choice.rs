//! Runtime coverage for the modal "As ~ enters, it becomes your choice of

//!
//! Cards in this class (built here directly from Oracle text via

//! which is absent in CI):
//!   - Primal Plasma: 3/3 | 2/2 flying | 1/6 defender
//!   - Primal Clay: 3/3 artifact | 2/2 artifact flying | 1/6 Wall artifact
//!     defender, all "in addition to its other types" (CR 205.1b additive)

//! submitted through the real `apply()` `GameAction::ChooseOption` handler so
//! the label persists as `ChosenAttribute::Label`; then `evaluate_layers` runs
//! and the object's effective P/T + keywords are asserted. Every P/T assertion
//! FLIPS on a revert of the `ChosenLabelIs`-gated SetPower/SetToughness statics:

//!
//! CR references (verified against `docs/MagicCompRules.txt`):
//!   - CR 208.2b: the modal as-enters replacement sets the creature's P/T to one
//!     of a number of specific values (and may list additional characteristics).
//!   - CR 614.1c: as-enters replacement effect.
//!   - CR 614.12a: the choice is made before the permanent enters.
//!   - CR 205.1b: Primal Clay "in addition to its other types" keeps prior types.
