//!   - Creeping Peeper — "{T}: Add {U}. Spend this mana only to cast an

//!   - Overgrown Zealot — "{T}: Add two mana of any one color. Spend this mana

//! CR 106.6 (restricted mana spend) + CR 708.4 (face-down spell) + CR 116.2b /
//! CR 702.37e (turn-face-up special action) + CR 116.2m / CR 709.5e (door
//! unlock).
//!
//! These tests drive the mana-payment route — `ManaPool::spend_for` with a
//! `PaymentContext` — proving the produced unit is CONSUMED for a legal spend
//! and WITHHELD for an illegal one.
//!
//! Three of the four restriction halves are LIVE on a production payment path
//! and one is HONEST-DEFERRED — be precise about which is which:
//!
//! - LIVE: the spell-type half (`OnlyForSpellType`, Creeping Peeper's
//!   enchantment branch), the door-unlock half
//!   (`OnlyForSpecialAction(UnlockDoor)`), and the turn-face-up half
//!   (`OnlyForSpecialAction(TurnFaceUp)`, Overgrown Zealot). All three reach
//!   `spend_for` through real production sites — `can_pay_for_spell` /
//!   `pay_cost_*` for casts, and `pay_special_action_mana_cost` for both door
//!   unlock (CR 116.2m) and turn-face-up (CR 116.2b, emitted by the
//!   `GameAction::TurnFaceUp` handler after `game::morph::turn_face_up_prepare`
//!   derives the morph/disguise/manifest cost) — so the `spend_for` assertion
//!   exercises the same `ManaRestriction::allows` decision a full `apply()`
//!   cast / unlock / turn-up makes.
//!
//! - HONEST-DEFERRED: the face-down-cast half (`OnlyForFaceDownSpell`, Tin
//!   Street Gossip). It is not reachable on a production payment path: CR 708.4
//!   face-down play (`GameAction::PlayFaceDown` → `game::morph::play_face_down`)
//!   moves the permanent via the zone pipeline and charges NO mana, so no site
//!   ever CASTS A SPELL FACE DOWN. The `OnlyForFaceDownSpell` gate is therefore
//!   fail-closed (under-permitting, not over-permitting): `SpellMeta.is_face_down`
//!   is sourced from the cast's face-down intent (`build_spell_meta`, hardcoded
//!   `false` today), not from `obj.face_down`, so the gate ALSO correctly REJECTS
//!   exile-concealment casts (foretell/hideaway) whose `obj.face_down = true` but
//!   which are cast face up (CR 702.143c). The tests below assert that contract
//!   directly: the gate REJECTS every production payment context, and the genuine
//!   face-down-cast positive is checked only at the restriction level (not via a
//!   production payment, which never sets `is_face_down = true`), matching the
//!   honest-deferred treatment.
//!
//! Revert-proof: each assertion flips if the corresponding gate is reverted —
//! see the per-test notes.
