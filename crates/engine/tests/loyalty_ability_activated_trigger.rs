//! Runtime coverage for the "Whenever you activate a loyalty ability of
//! [planeswalker]" trigger class (CR 606.2) — the GAP proofs from the
//! reviewed implementation plan.
//!
//! The discriminator design adds `ActivatedAbilityKind::{Normal,Loyalty}` to the
//! single `GameEvent::AbilityActivated` event (no new event), and a
//! `TriggerMode::LoyaltyAbilityActivated` matcher gated on `kind == Loyalty`.
//! The seam most likely to silently no-fire is the **targeted** loyalty
//! activation finalize (`game/casting_targets.rs`), where the kind is derived
//! from `pending.activation_cost`. These tests drive a *targeted* minus-loyalty
//! ability (two legal creature targets force the `TargetSelection` window and so
//! route through that finalize seam) and assert the trigger fires there.
//!
//! CARD TEXT (verified against MTGJSON AtomicCards.json):
//!   * Keral Keep Disciples — "Whenever you activate a loyalty ability of a
//!     Chandra planeswalker, this creature deals 1 damage to each opponent."
//!   * Elspeth's Talent — "... of enchanted planeswalker, creatures you control
//!     get +2/+2 and gain vigilance until end of turn."
//!
//! The loyalty ability itself is a generic targeted minus-loyalty ability built
//! from shipped building blocks (CR 606.1 loyalty cost + `Effect::DealDamage` to
//! `target creature`); the cards under test only need *some* loyalty ability of
//! the right planeswalker to be activated through the targeted finalize seam.
