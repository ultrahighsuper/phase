//! CR 601.2h / CR 601.2b regression guard for Harrow's "sacrifice a land"
//! additional cost. Two assertions:
//!
//! 1. **Parser-level** — the full Oracle Additional-Cost line parses to
//!    `Required(Sacrifice { Land, 1 })`. This is the static contract between
//!    `parser::oracle_casting::parse_additional_cost_line` and the runtime.
//!
//! 2. **Engine-level (single-authority)** — `AbilityCost::is_payable`
//!    rejects when the controller has no lands and accepts when they do.
//!    Per CLAUDE.md "single authority for ability costs," the legality gate
//!    must live in the engine (`game/cost_payability.rs`), not in
//!    `legal_actions` / AI / frontend pre-filtering.
