//! Integration tests for issue #562 — Manual Mana Paying: KCI sacrifice-cost
//! mana abilities must be exposed by the castability gate.
//!
//! Krark-Clan Ironworks (KCI) Oracle text:
//!   `Sacrifice an artifact: Add {C}{C}.`
//!
//! KCI is a **non-tap** mana ability (its cost is bare `Sacrifice`, not
//! `Composite { Tap, Sacrifice }`). Before this fix, `can_pay_cost_after_auto_tap`
//! could not see KCI as a mana source — auto-tap only simulates `{T}` activations.
//! That meant `can_cast_object_now` (the castability gate consumed by legal
//! actions) refused to expose `CastSpell { Ichor Wellspring }` even though the
//! player could legally pay `{2}` by manually activating KCI twice.
//!
//! The fix introduces `mana_sources::feasible_mana_capacity` (counts any
//! activatable mana ability, including sacrifice-cost ones) and
//! `casting::can_feasibly_pay_mana_cost` (delegates to auto-tap first, then
//! widens with the manual capacity scan). The legal-actions surface and
//! `max_x_value` route through the new predicate so the castability gate
//! matches what the manual payment flow can actually pay.
//
// CR 117.1d + CR 605.3a + CR 601.2g — mana abilities (including non-tap-cost
// ones) may be activated during cost payment.
