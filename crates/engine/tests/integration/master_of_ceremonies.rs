//! Integration tests for Master of Ceremonies's `Effect::Vote` shape:
//! `EachOpponent` voter scope plus `PlayerFilter::VotedFor` per-choice
//! routing, AND end-to-end fan-out of the parser-distributed
//! "you and that player each Y" reward bodies.
//!
//! The full upkeep trigger reads:
//!
//! > At the beginning of your upkeep, each opponent chooses money, friends,
//! > or secrets. For each player who chose money, you and that player each
//! > create a Treasure token. For each player who chose friends, you and that
//! > player each create a 1/1 green and white Citizen creature token. For each
//! > player who chose secrets, you and that player each draw a card.
//!
//! These tests validate the engine round-trip for both halves of the feature:
//! the voter skeleton (voter queue scoping CR 800.4g, ballot recording
//! CR 608.2c, `WaitingFor::VoteChoice` advancement CR 101.4 + CR 701.38d) AND
//! the post-tally distribution (CR 109.5 — first half routes to the
//! original ability controller; CR 608.2c + CR 800.4g — second half routes
//! to the matching voter via `PlayerFilter::VotedFor` + `TargetFilter::ScopedPlayer`).
//!
//! Per-choice bodies are parsed from real Oracle text via
//! `parse_effect_chain`, then tagged with `PlayerFilter::VotedFor { idx }`.
//! The body parser's compound-subject distribution combinator
//! (`try_parse_compound_subject_each`) emits the 2-element chain whose
//! halves carry distinct recipient filters.
