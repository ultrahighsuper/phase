//! MSH Wave 3 — Wolverine, Fierce Fighter: heal-prior-damage replacement.
//!
//! Oracle: "If damage would be dealt to Wolverine, instead that damage is dealt,
//! but all other damage already dealt to him is healed." (CR 614.1a replacement;
//! CR 120.6 marked damage; CR 510.2 combat-damage simultaneity.)
//!
//! The new damage instance IS dealt (no prevention); only the receiver's PRIOR
//! marked damage clears. The heal runs in Phase B (`dealt_damage_applier`,
//! before the Phase-C `damage_marked` increment), so same-batch combat
//! instances (CR 510.2) are preserved while only pre-batch damage heals.
