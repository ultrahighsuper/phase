//! Daretti, Scrap Savant emblem — simultaneous artifact death produces N
//! independent delayed-return triggers (issue #3075).
//!
//! Daretti's emblem text:
//!   "Whenever an artifact is put into your graveyard from the battlefield,
//!    return that card to the battlefield at the beginning of the next end step."
//!
//! The bug: when Blasphemous Act (or any board wipe) kills N artifact creatures
//! simultaneously, the emblem trigger should fire N independent times — once per
//! ZoneChanged event — and create N independent AtNextPhase{End} delayed
//! triggers, each snapshotting a distinct artifact. At the beginning of the next
//! end step, all N delayed triggers fire and return all N artifacts to the
//! battlefield.
//!
//! The emblem is not a permanent and functions from the command zone (CR 114.4).
//! Its triggers must be scanned via the command-zone path in
//! `collect_pending_triggers`, which resets `registered_this_event` between
//! events (CR 603.2c) and uses `batched_this_pass` for "one or more" guards.
//! Daretti's trigger is NOT batched, so each ZoneChanged event fires it
//! independently.
//!
//! CR references (verified against `docs/MagicCompRules.txt`):
//!   - CR 114.1 + CR 114.4: Emblems function from the command zone; their
//!     triggered abilities are active outside the battlefield.
//!   - CR 603.2c: "An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event
//!     occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly if one event contains multiple
//!     occurrences." N simultaneous artifact deaths are N distinct ZoneChanged
//!     events, so the emblem trigger fires N times.
//!   - CR 603.3: Triggered abilities go on the stack the next time a player
//!     would receive priority — N trigger instances go on the stack.
//!   - CR 603.7 + CR 603.7b: Delayed triggers created by resolving the emblem
//!     trigger fire "at the beginning of the next end step" (AtNextPhase{End})
//!     and are consumed (one-shot) after firing.
//!   - CR 704.5g + CR 704.7: Simultaneous SBA destruction — all creatures with
//!     lethal damage are destroyed in one batch.
