//! Integration tests for Madame Null, Power Broker (TMT).
//!
//! Oracle text:
//!   Deathtouch
//!   Whenever another creature you control enters, you may pay life equal to
//!   its power. If you do, put that many +1/+1 counters on it.
//!
//! These tests pin the
//! `PayCost { Life(Ref(Power { scope: CostPaidObject })) }`
//! resolution enabled by the PayCost life-cost → QuantityExpr widening. The
//! `CostPaidObject` scope resolves (CR 608.2k) via cost-paid object →
//! trigger-event source → effect-context object; with no cost-paid object
//! these tests exercise the trigger-event-source (slot 2) fallback:
//!   - Live source: power read from `current_trigger_event`'s source object.
//!   - LKI fallback (CR 400.7 / CR 608.2f): if the source has left its zone
//!     between trigger firing and resolution, power is read from the LKI
//!     snapshot — exactly what the TMT ruling requires.
//!   - Unpayable cost: CR 119.8 — insufficient life sets
//!     `cost_payment_failed_flag`, which gates the paired `IfYouDo`
//!     sub-ability so no counters are placed.
//!
//! The "you may" outer prompt (CR 603.2) is engine plumbing that early-returns
//! into a `WaitingFor::OptionalEffectChoice`; it's covered by the action
//! dispatch tests and is intentionally bypassed here to isolate the cost
//! resolver under test.

/// Builds a Madame Null-shaped chain: outer PayCost(Life(SourcePower)) with

/// detect via side-effects on `cost_payment_failed_flag` / life total).
///
/// The real sub-ability is `PutCounter(ParentTarget, EventContextAmount)`,
/// but that requires a live parent-target chain. These tests narrow to the
/// question my commit actually enables: does the outer PayCost route the
/// entering creature's power through `resolve_quantity_with_targets` into
/// `pay_life_as_cost` correctly, and do the "you may" / IfYouDo gates
/// compose as expected? The PutCounter integration is exercised elsewhere
/// (Floodpits Drowner stun counter, Ultimate Spider-Man +1/+1).
/// The ability built here omits `optional = true` deliberately: the "you may"
/// prompt is engine plumbing that early-returns into a `WaitingFor` choice
/// state (exercised via the action-dispatch loop in other tests). Removing
/// the optional flag isolates what this commit actually changed — the
/// `PayCost` resolver routing `QuantityExpr` through
/// `resolve_quantity_with_targets` into `pay_life_as_cost`.
