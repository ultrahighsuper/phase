//! Regression for issue #328: Gatta and Luzzu's damage-prevention ETB was
//! reported as failing — the targeted creature died because (a) the shield
//! was being installed on Gatta itself instead of the chosen target, (b) the
//! prevention shield was depletion-based (`Next(1)`) so it absorbed only the
//! first damage event, and (c) the rider's "it" anaphor in
//! "put that many +1/+1 counters on it" was binding to `SelfRef` (Gatta)
//! rather than the parent's chosen target.
//!
//! Oracle text:
//!     "Flash
//!      When Gatta and Luzzu enters, choose target creature you control. If
//!      damage would be dealt to that creature this turn, prevent that damage
//!      and put that many +1/+1 counters on it."
//!
//! This test pins the full chained-trigger shape end-to-end:
//!   TargetOnly { Creature, You }
//!     → sub_ability: PreventDamage { All, ParentTarget, AllDamage }
//!         duration: UntilEndOfTurn
//!         → sub_ability: PutCounter { P1P1, target: ParentTarget }
//!             repeat_for: EventContextAmount
//!
//! And the runtime contracts:
//!   - The `Prevention { All }` shield persists across multiple damage events
//!     (CR 615.1a — only `Next(N)` shields are depletion-based per CR 615.7).
//!   - The shield is hosted on the *chosen* creature, not Gatta (CR 608.2c —
//!     `ParentTarget` aliases to the parent's selected target).
//!   - Each prevented damage event accumulates `+1/+1` counters on the chosen
//!     creature, one per 1 damage prevented (CR 615.5 — additional effect that
//!     refers to the prevented amount, fired immediately after each prevention).
//!
//! CR 608.2c: Later instructions may refer to a target chosen earlier in the
//!            same effect.
//! CR 615.1a: Effects that use the word "prevent" are prevention effects.
//! CR 615.5:  Prevention effects may include an additional effect that refers
//!            to the amount of damage prevented; the additional effect runs
//!            immediately after the prevention.
//! CR 615.7:  `Prevent the next N damage` is a depletion shield. (Distinct
//!            from this card's `Prevent that damage` formulation.)
//! CR 514.2:  "This turn" effects end at the cleanup step.
