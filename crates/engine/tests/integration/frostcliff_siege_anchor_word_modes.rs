//! Integration coverage for Frostcliff Siege (Tarkir: Dragonstorm, {1}{U}{R}).
//!
//! Oracle text:
//!   "As this enchantment enters, choose Jeskai or Temur.
//!    • Jeskai — Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage
//!      to a player, draw a card.
//!    • Temur — Creatures you control get +1/+0 and have trample and haste."
//!
//! Exercises the CR 614.12c + CR 607.2d anchor-word linked-ability machinery
//! end-to-end. The parser lowers the card to:
//!   - one `Moved` `ReplacementDefinition` whose execute is
//!     `Effect::Choose { ChoiceType::Labeled["Jeskai","Temur"], persist: true }`
//!     so the controller's answer is persisted on the Siege as
//!     `ChosenAttribute::Label`;
//!   - one `TriggerDefinition` (Jeskai mode) gated by
//!     `TriggerCondition::ChosenLabelIs { label: "Jeskai" }`;
//!   - one `StaticDefinition` (Temur mode) gated by
//!     `StaticCondition::ChosenLabelIs { label: "Temur" }`.
//!
//! CR references (verified against `docs/MagicCompRules.txt`):
//!   - CR 614.12c: "Some replacement effects cause a permanent to enter the
//!     battlefield with its controller's choice of one of two abilities, each
//!     marked with an anchor word and preceded by a bullet point." — the
//!     authorising rule for the as-enters anchor-word choice and the linked
//!     abilities it controls.
//!   - CR 607.2d: Linked abilities — when an object has an ability that
//!     causes a player to "choose a [value]" and an ability that refers to
//!     "the chosen [value]," those abilities are linked. The anchor-word
//!     bulleted ability is the chooser-side; the named-label-marked ability
//!     is the chosen-side.
//!   - CR 113.6 + CR 113.6b: Static abilities function only on the battlefield
//!     (default for both the chosen-label gate and the granted continuous
//!     effects).
//!   - CR 603.2 + CR 603.4: A triggered ability triggers when the event
//!     occurs; its intervening-if is checked at fire-time AND resolution-time
//!     (CR 603.4) — `ChosenLabelIs` returns false on the Temur reading so the
//!     Jeskai trigger never fires when Temur was chosen.
//!   - CR 510.1b: A creature deals combat damage equal to its power.
//!   - CR 121.1: A draw moves the top card from the library to the player's
//!     hand.
//!   - CR 613.4c (P/T modification) + CR 613.1f (keyword grant): The Temur
//!     static contributes `AddPower(+1)` in layer 7c and `AddKeyword(Trample)`
//!     / `AddKeyword(Haste)` in layer 6.
//!
//! The tests below load Frostcliff Siege from the real `card-data.json`
//! database (so any parser regression in the as-enters anchor-word lowering
//! breaks integration coverage) and then drive each mode through the real
//! `apply()` pipeline.
