//! Pipeline regression for **Call Damage Control** (MSH, green sorcery).
//!
//! Oracle:
//!   Choose up to two. Return those cards from your graveyard to your hand.
//!   • Target artifact card.
//!   • Target creature card.
//!   • Target enchantment card.
//!   • Target land card.
//!
//! The four bullet modes are bare targets; the shared return-to-hand effect is
//! phrased once in the header ("Return those cards from your graveyard to your
//! hand."). Before the fix, each mode lowered to
//! `Effect::Unimplemented { name: "target", description: "Target <type> card" }`
//! and the shared effect was dropped entirely — the spell did nothing.
//!
//! The fix distributes the header's shared `those <noun>` effect across every
//! bare-target mode (parser: `distribute_shared_mode_effect`), so each chosen
//! mode resolves an independent graveyard-to-hand `Effect::ChangeZone` of a card
//! of its card-type, parameterized solely by card-type.
//!
//! CR 700.2 / CR 700.2a: modal spell; the controller chooses the mode(s) and an
//! illegal mode (no legal target) can't be chosen.
//! CR 700.2c / CR 601.2c: each chosen mode supplies its own single target.
//! CR 404.1: the graveyard is the source zone for the returned cards.
