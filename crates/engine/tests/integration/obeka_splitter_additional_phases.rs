//! Issues #1486 / #1533 — Obeka, Splitter of Seconds drops "that many".
//!
//! Oracle (Obeka, Splitter of Seconds):
//! > Menace
//! > Whenever Obeka deals combat damage to a player, you get that many
//! > additional upkeep steps after this phase.
//!
//! Before the fix, the parser produced `Effect::AdditionalPhase` with no count
//! field, so the resolver pushed exactly one extra upkeep step regardless of
//! the combat damage delivered. After the fix, the parser threads
//! `QuantityRef::EventContextAmount` into `Effect::AdditionalPhase { count, .. }`
//! and the resolver pushes one bundle per point of damage.
//!
//! CR 500.8 (extra phases), CR 510.2 (combat damage dealt), CR 503.1
//! (upkeep step).
//!
//! This test drives an unblocked 5/2 Obeka into P1, then asserts that the
//! resolved trigger queued 5 additional upkeep steps — discriminating against
//! the broken behaviour (1 step).
