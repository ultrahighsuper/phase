//! CR 603.3b + CR 603.4 + CR 106.1 / CR 119 / CR 122.1: the PR-6.25/PR-6.5 fail-closed AST
//! scanner — a single compiler-exhaustive, wildcard-free walk of a resolved
//! ability's typed AST that answers three independent classification questions
//! ("axes") used by trigger ordering (CR 603.3b) and the growing-cascade
//! coverability detector (`analysis::resource`):
//!
//! 1. **event-context read** — does the ability read a characteristic of the
//!    concrete triggering event / cost-paid object (CR 603.4 / CR 608.2k)? Two
//!    order-independent-looking triggers off *distinct* events are only truly
//!    interchangeable if neither reads the event that distinguishes them.
//! 2. **sibling-mutable read** — does the ability read a source/recipient or
//!    board-scoped mutable P/T / counter aggregate that a sibling copy resolving
//!    first could change (the Rubblebelt Rioters / Orcish Siegemaster class)?
//! 3. **projected-resource read** — does the ability read a player-level monotone
//!    resource or per-turn/per-game journal that
//!    `analysis::resource::project_out_resources` zeroes/clears (life CR 119,
//!    floating mana CR 106.1, poison/energy/player counters CR 122.1, and the
//!    per-turn tally/journal block)? Object counters and marked damage are NOT on
//!    this axis — they are strict-compared by gate (1) of
//!    `loop_states_cover_modulo_growth` (R5-B1), so an object-counter reader
//!    (`CountersOn`/`Power`/`Toughness`) classifies as a NON-reader here.
//!
//! # Why hand-rolled and wildcard-free
//!
//! The soundness of both consumers rests on the scanner being **fail-closed on
//! future variants**: a new `Effect`/`QuantityRef`/`TriggerCondition`/… variant
//! must fail to compile until it is given an explicit reads/doesn't-read decision
//! on every axis. A `_ =>` wildcard (or a serde-tag string walk) silently defeats
//! that — a new event-context or resource reader would be classified inert and
//! ride a false auto-resolution / false coverability win. Therefore every arm is
//! explicit; provably-inert variants get a one-line `Axes::NONE` arm. Types the
//! walk does not descend into (`ContinuousModification`, `ManaProduction`,
//! `ReplacementDefinition`, a nested `ResolvedAbility`, `FilterProp`, the
//! per-mode `AbilityDefinition`s of a reflexive-modal trigger (`mode_abilities`),
//! …) that can transitively express a read are classified **conservatively**
//! (`Axes::CONSERVATIVE` — reads on every axis), the fail-safe direction for all
//! three consumers (over-prompt / over-reject, never a false auto-resolve or
//! false win). `RestrictionPlayerScope` and `CastManaObjectScope` are also in the
//! conservative set: their only carriers (`Effect::AddRestriction` /
//! `AddTargetReplacement`, `QuantityRef::ManaSpentToCast`) already return
//! `Axes::CONSERVATIVE`, so the scopes themselves are never traversed.
//!
//! # Traversal closure (R4-G2)
//!
//! The compiler-exhaustiveness floor holds only for TRAVERSED subtrees: an
//! untraversed payload is silently skipped with no compile error, so the traversal
//! set is part of the trusted base. It is closed under payload reachability across
//! `Effect`, `QuantityRef`, `QuantityExpr`, `AbilityCondition`, `TargetFilter`,
//! `ObjectScope`, `TriggerCondition`, `Duration` (its `ForAsLongAs` `StaticCondition`),
//! `StaticCondition`, `PlayerFilter`, `ReplacementCondition`, the target-count and
//! target-set specs (`MultiTargetSpec`, `TargetSelectionConstraint`), the loop and
//! modal headers (`RepeatContinuation`, `ModalChoice`), and the player scope
//! selectors (`PlayerScope`, `ControllerRef`, `CountScope`). The `ResolvedAbility`
//! and `ModalChoice` fields are destructured without `..`, so a new field must be
//! classified before it compiles. Any type outside this set that can reach a read
//! is in the conservative set above.
//!
//! # Resolution-time choice classifier (a SEPARATE question family)
//!
//! Alongside the three read-axes lives an independent classifier
//! (`effect_resolution_choice_freedom` / `ability_resolution_choice_freedom`,
//! consumed by `analysis::resource::loop_states_cover_modulo_growth` item 6)
//! answering a FOURTH, orthogonal question (CR 608.2d): can resolving this
//! ability enter a resolution-time player choice (a non-priority `WaitingFor`)?
//! This is deliberately NOT a fourth `Axes` axis — `Axes::NONE` means "no
//! reads", which is orthogonal to "never prompts" (`Effect::Scry` reads nothing
//! yet always prompts), so folding a choice bit into `Axes` would make every
//! existing `NONE` arm silently claim choice-freeness. The classifier is
//! fail-closed (`MayPrompt` default — an unproven claim only costs a
//! false-negative cover rejection); promoting a variant to a choice-free
//! verdict is a SOUNDNESS claim ("resolving can never enter a non-priority
//! `WaitingFor`, for ANY state") and requires a resolver trace cited in the arm
//! plus a `..`-free destructure so a future field forces re-audit.
//!
//! # Consumers of the read-axis classifiers after PR-6.75
//!
//! CR 603.3b: the legacy UNGATED trigger-ordering paths (same firing event, and
//! the explicitly-simultaneous ZoneChanged departure batch) no longer consume the
//! event-context / sibling-mutable read classifiers of this scanner. They consume
//! the richer kind/scope read/write conflict profile in the sibling module
//! `ability_rw.rs` (`ability_rw_profile` / `trigger_condition_rw_profile` /
//! `profiles_conflict`), which answers "which kinds of state does the ability READ
//! and WRITE, at what scope" — the precise read/write predicate those paths require
//! (PR-6.25 §3 C0(ii)). The event-context and sibling-mutable read classifiers here
//! are now consumed ONLY by the C2 distinct-event term (`group_is_order_independent`
//! / `trigger_events_match_for_ordering`), ungated from loop detection (adopted from
//! #5084) and conjoined with `!batch_conflict` — so a coarse C2-clean verdict may
//! auto-order a distinct-event group only when the precise `ability_rw` profiler also
//! agrees it is conflict-clean; a conservative verdict here means a prompt (safe
//! over-reject). The projected-resource classifier (question 3) and the
//! resolution-time choice classifier (question 4) are unchanged. See `ability_rw.rs`
//! for the conflict model and its CR 603.3b commutation argument.
