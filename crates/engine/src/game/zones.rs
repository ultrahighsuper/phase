/// Two documented limitations, both arising because this helper reads

///    lives in the layers pipeline (layers.rs), which this helper bypasses.
///    Persistence here is therefore gated by `excluded_zones`, not by
///    `active_zones`. This is sound for the shipping cards because their
///    `excluded_zones` (Hand, Library) coincide with the inactive zones where
///    objects never carry counters. A future `CountersPersistAcrossZones` card
///    with a different active/excluded split would need an explicit
///    `active_zones` check added here.
///
/// 2. Layer-6 ability removal (Humility / Yixlid Jailer's "Cards in graveyards
///    lose all abilities"): `evaluate_layers` (layers.rs) only applies layers to
///    battlefield + hand objects, so a graveyard/exile object's
///    `static_definitions` never has its abilities stripped. With Yixlid Jailer
///    in play and Me/Skullbriar in a graveyard bearing counters, this helper
///    still observes the persistence static and would INCORRECTLY persist the
///    counters on a graveyard→exile move — CR 113.6b reads the ability from the
///    from-zone state, where it is rules-meant to be removed. This is not a
///    regression (graveyard ability-removal is unmodeled engine-wide), but it is
///    a known-wrong interaction on this new path, called out here explicitly
///    rather than left implicit.
