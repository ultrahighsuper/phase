//! CR 702.113a: Awaken — append the awaken resolution rider to a spell.
//!
//! "Awaken N—[cost]" represents two abilities (CR 702.113a): a static ability
//! that lets you pay the awaken cost instead of the spell's mana cost (wired in
//! `casting.rs`), and a spell ability — "If this spell's awaken cost was paid,
//! put N +1/+1 counters on target land you control. That land becomes a 0/0
//! Elemental creature with haste. It's still a land."
//!
//! When a spell is cast with `CastingVariant::Awaken`, [`append_awaken_rider`]
//! appends that spell ability to the TAIL of the spell's existing ability tree
//! at cast-preparation time. Appending (rather than transforming) preserves
//! CR 702.113a's "ALSO put ..." ordering: the printed effect resolves first,
//! then the awaken rider. The rider is only appended on the awaken variant, so a
//! normal cast leaves the ability tree untouched and requests no land target
//! (CR 702.113b: the awaken target exists only if the awaken cost was paid).
//!
//! Single authority: every call site routes through [`append_awaken_rider`].
//! The rider is composed entirely from existing effect primitives —
//! `Effect::PutCounter` surfaces the one land target slot (CR 601.2c), and a
//! chained `Effect::Animate` sub-ability inherits that chosen land via the
//! unconditional sub-target inheritance in `effects::resolve_ability_chain` (it
//! references `TargetFilter::ParentTarget`, a context ref that surfaces no extra
//! slot). No new `Effect`, `CounterType`, `Duration`, or `ContinuousModification`
//! variant is introduced.
