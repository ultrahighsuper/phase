//! CR 119.7 + CR 119.8: Resolver for `Effect::RedistributeLifeTotals`.
//!
//! "Redistribute any number of players' life totals. (Each of those players gets
//! one life total back.)" (Reverse the Sands, The Doctor's Tomb). The controlling
//! player chooses how to reassign the participating players' current life totals
//! among themselves — a controller-chosen permutation of the life-total pool.
//!
//! Because choosing "any number of players" and permuting only that subset's
//! totals is equivalent to a permutation of the *full* candidate set that fixes
//! the unchosen players, the resolver enumerates every permutation of the
//! candidate players' current life totals, filters each receiver by CR 119.7
//! (can't gain) / CR 119.8 (can't lose), dedupes behaviorally-identical outcomes,
//! and installs `WaitingFor::RedistributeLifeTotals` for the controller to pick.
//! The identity ("keep current totals") assignment is always legal and always
//! offered. When it is the only legal outcome, the effect resolves as a rules-
//! correct no-op with no prompt.
//!
//! CR 810.9f (a player may not affect more than one member of each team) is out
//! of scope: the engine is fixed two-player with no teams.
