//! CR 901: Planechase — the planar deck, planeswalking, the planar die, and
//! chaos resolution.
//!
//! Planes (CR 311) and phenomena (CR 312) are nontraditional cards that remain
//! in the command zone throughout the game (CR 311.2 / CR 312.2). In the
//! single-planar-deck option (CR 901.15) the engine tracks one shared deck in
//! [`GameState::planar_deck`]; the single active face-up card lives in
//! [`GameState::command_zone`], while the rest of the deck (face down) is held
//! in `planar_deck` (front = top).
//!
//! This module is the runtime score-lever: it owns planeswalking
//! ([`planeswalk`]), the planar die ([`roll_planar_die`]), chaos resolution
//! ([`chaos_ensues`]), the phenomenon encounter entry point ([`encounter`]),
//! and the phenomenon-leaves-stack state-based planeswalk
//! ([`check_phenomenon_planeswalk_sba`]).
//!
//! Trigger collection is NOT performed here. Like every other event-emitting
//! subsystem (e.g. dungeon completion in `sba::check_dungeon_completion`), these
//! functions push `GameEvent`s into the caller's event buffer; the engine loop
//! then turns those events into triggers via `collect_triggers_into_deferred`.
//! Plane/phenomenon triggers are scanned from the command zone because
//! `synthesize_planechase` stamps `trigger_zones = [Zone::Command]` onto them
//! (CR 113.6b), which makes `trigger_opts_in_to_command_zone` admit them.
