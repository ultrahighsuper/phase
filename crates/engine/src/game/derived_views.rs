//! Engine-authored presentation projections over `GameState`.
//!
//! These "derived views" are computed just-in-time at serialization
//! boundaries (the WASM getter, the server-core broadcast) and sent to
//! clients alongside the raw state. Display consumers (React components)
//! consume the pre-grouped shape directly and never compute game logic
//! themselves — per CLAUDE.md's "engine owns all logic" invariant.
//!
//! Contrast with `crates/engine/src/game/derived.rs`, which contains
//! engine-internal state derivation (summoning sickness, commander damage
//! aggregation, etc.). This module is a thin presentation-facing wrapper
//! that composes those helpers into a client-ready shape.

///
/// A payload-keyed axis names the player it acts on, so the badge follows the

/// - CR 704.5a: `Life(p)` — a drain drives an opponent's life down (the win
///   condition is the afflicted player reaching 0 life) and lifegain raises the
///   controller's own; either way the badge belongs on `p`'s HUD.
/// - CR 120: `DamageDealt(p)` — damage accrues to the player it is dealt to, so an
///   opponent-burn loop shows `∞` on the victim's HUD.
/// - CR 704.5b: `LibraryDelta(p)` — a mill drives an opponent's library toward the
///   empty-draw loss and a self-mill the controller's own; the badge follows `p`.
///
/// Every aggregate axis carries no victim PlayerId and is attributed to the loop's
/// `controller` (the player generating the unbounded resource).
//
// CR 704.5c: a player with ten or more poison counters loses the game — so the
// *afflicted* player owns the win condition, and a poison ∞ belongs on the VICTIM's
// HUD. But `Counter(Poison, ObjectClass::Player)` is AGGREGATE-keyed in ResourceVector
// (no victim PlayerId; loop_check.rs:239-246 reads the summed (Poison, Player) pair),
// so it falls into the aggregate `=> controller` arm and is controller-attributed here.
// This is correct ONLY because no live producer emits a poison axis in PR-6 (the mana
// toggle is the sole producer). PR-7 MUST NOT wire a live poison loop until the analysis
// poison axis is re-keyed by victim PlayerId, or ∞ would render on the wrong HUD.
