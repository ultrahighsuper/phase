//! Single authority for iterating "ability definitions that function right now."
//!
//! Statics, triggers, and replacements each live on `GameObject`s, but they
//! are gated by different CR rules. Every read site that previously
//! iterated `obj.static_definitions` / `obj.trigger_definitions` /
//! `obj.replacement_definitions` directly has to apply these gates itself,
//! which has been a recurring source of bugs. This module centralizes the
//! gating so callers cannot silently drop:
//!
//! - **CR 702.26b** — phased-out permanents' abilities don't function.
//! - **CR 114.4** — objects in the command zone don't function unless they
//!   are emblems.
//! - **CR 604.1 / CR 613.1** — a static ability only applies while its
//!   `condition` evaluates true (continuous re-evaluation).
//!
//! # Zone scope asymmetry
//!
//! - **Statics / triggers**: gated to the battlefield by the caller's choice
//!   of iteration (`battlefield_active_*`). Command-zone emblems pass the
//!   phased-out/command-zone gate for per-object iteration, and non-emblem
//!   command-zone objects may contribute definitions that explicitly opt in
//!   via `active_zones` / `trigger_zones`.
//! - **Replacements**: NOT battlefield-scoped. Zone-of-function is a
//!   per-replacement property on `ReplacementDefinition`, so
//!   `active_replacements` scans every object and only applies the
//!   phased-out / command-zone gate. Caller-side zone restriction still
//!   lives in `find_applicable_replacements`, which today filters to
//!   `[Battlefield, Command]` because no in-engine replacement functions
//!   from hand / graveyard / exile. CR 903.9a commander redirection is
//!   handled separately in `zones::move_to_zone` — it is not routed
//!   through `ReplacementDefinition`.
//!
//! # Condition filtering
//!
//! Only `active_static_definitions` filters by `condition`
//! (CR 604.1 / CR 613.1 — statics are evaluated continuously). Trigger
//! intervening-if (CR 603.4) is a two-point check at trigger placement and
//! resolution, and replacement-effect conditions (CR 616) are evaluated at
//! event time. Both of those checks stay at their existing pipeline
//! checkpoints, so these helpers deliberately do NOT filter triggers or
//! replacements by their own `condition` fields.
