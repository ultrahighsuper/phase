//! Mana source analysis for auto-pay and AI candidate generation.
//!
//! `ManaSourceOption` describes a single activatable mana path, annotated
//! with a single typed `ManaSourcePenalty` that captures the full penalty
//! axis (damage on resolution, pay-life on activation, sacrifice) plus its
//! amount where known. Every consumer (auto-tap sort, `max_x_value`
//! free-producer gating, `UntapLandForMana` undoability) reads the penalty
//! via the enum's methods — no consumer re-inspects the underlying
//! `AbilityDefinition`, eliminating the drift class where independent bool
//! flags could diverge between construction and consumption.
//!
//! CR 605.3a defines mana abilities; CR 605.3b establishes their atomic
//! inline resolution — which is why any irreversible sub-effect (damage,
//! life loss, sacrifice) disqualifies a source from UI-level undo.
