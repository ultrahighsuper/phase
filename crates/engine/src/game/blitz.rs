//! Blitz (CR 702.152) — alternative-cost runtime riders.
//!
//! CR 702.152a: "Blitz [cost]" means "You may cast this card by paying [cost]
//! rather than its mana cost," and — if the blitz cost was paid — the permanent
//! it becomes gains **haste** and "When this permanent is put into a graveyard
//! from the battlefield, draw a card," and you **sacrifice it at the beginning
//! of the next end step."
//!
//! The alternative cost itself is wired into the casting pipeline as
//! `CastingVariant::Blitz` (offered like Evoke, substituted like Warp). This
//! module owns the *resolution riders*: when a blitz-cast spell resolves into a
//! permanent, [`install_blitz_riders`] grants the three abilities directly to
//! that permanent.
//!
//! Why grant at resolution rather than synthesize tag-gated abilities onto the
//! face (the Evoke/Impending pattern): the dies-draw is a *leaves-the-battlefield*
//! trigger, and `cast_variant_paid` is cleared by the new-object reset
//! (`game_object.rs`) as the permanent moves to the graveyard — so a trigger
//! gated on that tag would never fire on death. Granting the rider directly (its
//! *presence* on the permanent is the gate, like Suspend's runtime haste and
//! granted-Evoke's runtime trigger) sidesteps that entirely: the trigger is part
//! of the dying object's last-known information and fires normally (CR 603.10a).
