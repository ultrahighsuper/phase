//! CR 701.38 + CR 207.2c: Council's-dilemma / Will-of-the-Council voting parser.
//!
//! This module owns recognition of the full vote effect block:
//!
//! ```text
//! starting with you, each player votes for <choice-a> or <choice-b>.
//! For each <choice-a> vote, <effect-a>.
//! For each <choice-b> vote, <effect-b>.
//! ```
//!
//! Output: a synthesized `Effect::Vote` whose `per_choice_effect` slots carry
//! the parsed sub-effects in `choices` declaration order.
//!
//! Architectural rules:
//! * Nom combinators for ALL dispatch — never `find` / `contains` / `split_once`.
//! * Builds for the *class* of cards (every Will-of-the-Council / Council's-
//!   dilemma vote with two-or-more named choices), not just Tivit.
//! * The detector is pure: given vote text, it returns the synthesized
//!   `AbilityDefinition`. Failure to match returns `None`, leaving the caller
//!   free to fall back to the standard chain parser.
