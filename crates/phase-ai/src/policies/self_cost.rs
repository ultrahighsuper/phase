//! Net-value gate for self-cost ability activations.
//!
//! An activated ability whose *cost* spends the AI's own resources — it
//! sacrifices a permanent, pays life, discards, or exiles cards from the AI's
//! own hand/graveyard — should only be activated when its *effect* buys
//! something worth the loss. The free-outlet policy only prices creature
//! sacrifice for aristocrats outlets; land-sacrifice lifegain (Zuran Orb),
//! pay-life pingers, discard-to-grant loops, and self-exile-from-graveyard
//! grants all slip past it, so the AI cracks them every turn for nothing.
//!
//! This module is the single authority that (1) recognizes those four cost
//! shapes on the `AbilityCost` tree, (2) prices the self-inflicted cost, and
//! (3) decides whether the ability's immediate payoff is trivial. It is
//! deliberately conservative: anything whose payoff scales or is ambiguous —
//! mana production, land search, large or power-derived damage, beneficial
//! counters — is treated as non-trivial, so ramp, fixing, burn finishers, and
//! counter payoffs are never suppressed. Off-ability synergy (an aristocrats
//! board that turns each death into value, a lifegain/reanimator shell that
//! wants the resource spent) stands the gate down entirely.
//!
//! Only the *scoring* half lives here; the thin `SelfCostValuePolicy` adapter
//! (`self_cost_value.rs`) fetches the activated ability and turns these
//! predicates into a `PolicyVerdict`.
