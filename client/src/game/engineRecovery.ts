/**
 * Transparent engine-state recovery for the STATE_LOST failure mode.
 *
 * Background: the WASM engine keeps game state in a thread-local
 * `RefCell<Option<GameState>>`. When that cell becomes `None` mid-session
 * (worker restart, PWA update activation race, panic recovery, or an
 * explicit `clear_game_state()` without a corresponding store reset), every
 * subsequent engine call fails with the Rust sentinel `NOT_INITIALIZED: ...`.
 * The React store still holds a valid `gameState` snapshot from before the
 * loss — this module uses that snapshot to transparently repopulate the
 * engine so the user never sees the error.
 *
 * Mode matrix:
 * - `ai` / `local` → `adapter.restoreState(storeState)`. Supported here.
 * - `p2p-host`     → Host recovery requires the full resume-from-persisted
 *                    session path (guest seat reservations, WebRTC grace
 *                    windows, multiplayer-flag flip via
 *                    `resumeMultiplayerHostState`). The P2PHostAdapter
 *                    doesn't expose those on the EngineAdapter interface,
 *                    and a mid-recovery hiccup could desync seats. We
 *                    punt to the Layer 3 reload path, which triggers the
 *                    host's existing `initialize()` resume flow from IDB.
 * - `p2p-join`     → Guests do not hold authoritative WASM state; their
 *                    failure mode is host-disconnect, handled by the P2P
 *                    adapter's auto-reconnect loop. Skipped here.
 * - `online` (WS)  → Server is authoritative; local rehydrate is impossible.
 *                    The WS adapter has its own reconnection logic.
 *
 * Recovery is best-effort. `false` means the caller must escalate to the
 * user-facing Layer 3 reload prompt via `notifyEngineLost`.
