/**
 * Read-only adapter for the Replay Viewer. Backed by its own dedicated
 * `EngineWorkerClient` — never the live game's worker — so loading or
 * scrubbing a replay can never touch, or be touched by, an in-progress game.
 *
 * Only `loadReplay` / `seek` / `length` / `header` / `dispose` do real work.
 * The rest of the `EngineAdapter` surface exists so a `ReplayAdapter` can sit
 * in `useGameStore.adapter` the same way a live-game adapter does; the
 * Replay Viewer always runs with `gameMode: "spectate"`, which already
 * short-circuits `dispatchAction` before any of these would be reached (see
 * `game/dispatch.ts`) — they no-op/throw here as a defense-in-depth
 * backstop, not as the primary safety mechanism.
